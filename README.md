## Hi, I'm Roksana 👋

🔭 **I’m currently working as** a Machine Learning Engineer at Sainsbury’s, making ML-driven data pipelines and GenAI prototypes more production-ready than they were ever meant to be  
🧪 **This page is** my fun coding space to explore ideas, break things, and occasionally discover something useful
