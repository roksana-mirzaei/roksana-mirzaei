🔭 **I’m currently working as** a Machine Learning Engineer at Sainsbury’s, making ML-driven data pipelines and GenAI prototypes more production-ready than they were ever meant to be  

🌱 **I’m currently learning** diffusion / flow-matching models, LLM reasoning, agents, and why distributed systems fail at 3am  

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on** agentic AI, diffusion models, autonomous systems, RAG/GraphRAG, and anything that turns research ideas into real systems  

💬 **Ask me about** MLOps, Airflow/dbt, LLM agents, diffusion models, or debugging “this should not happen” bugs  

🧪 **This page is** my fun coding space to explore ideas, break things, and occasionally discover something useful
