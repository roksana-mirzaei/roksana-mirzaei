🔭 I’m currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Sainsbury's. I work on making ML driven data pipelines and GenAI prototypes more production-ready than they were ever meant to be

🌱 I’m currently learning diffusion / flow-matching models, LLM reasoning, Agents, and why distributed systems fail at 3am

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on agentic AI, diffusion models, autonomous systems, RAG/GraphRAG, and anything that turns research ideas into real systems

🤔 I’m looking for help with staying opinionated and flexible when designing large ML systems

💬 Ask me about MLOps, Airflow/dbt, LLM agents, diffusion models, or debugging “this should not happen” bugs

🧪 This page is my fun coding space to explore ideas, break things, and occasionally discover something useful

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy findng bugs, optimizing pipelines almost as much as I enjoy discovering that a single wrong join caused a 25× KPI over-reporting
